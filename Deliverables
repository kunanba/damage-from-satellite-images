Deliverables for Project 
 
 this tool (a web-app or a mobile app) will expect to get, as an input, a list of addresses. It will retrieve screen shots of the structures from Google Street View. The students will design a damage assessment form, which, in addition to relevant information about the level of damage to the structures, will also provide a pre-event photo of the assessed structure.
